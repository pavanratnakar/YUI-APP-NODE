YUI 3: App Framework Example Using Node
========================================

In this tutorial I have implemented a web app end to end using YUI and hosted in Node.  App is going to show weather details for given woeid. It will illustrate everything you need to create a client and server in JavaScript using YUI App and Node.

YUI is incredibly well documented. Alright, lets do a quick overview of how program flow works, don’t worry, it’s actually a lot less complicated than it looks. It is initially over-engineered. However, in the end you basically have the bones of everything you need to create a larger more complex application and a code structure that will scale with your complexity.

Exampe uses express powered server. In Node.js 6-9 lines of code provides a full functioning if somewhat basic web server. 

Starting the server is as simple as running node server.js from your command line.
