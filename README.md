YUI 3: App Framework Example Using Node
========================================

In this tutorial I have implemented a web app end to end using YUI and hosted in Node.  App is going to show weather details for given woeid. It will illustrate everything you need to create a client and server in JavaScript using YUI App and Node.

YUI is incredibly well documented. Donâ€™t worry, program is a lot less complicated than it looks. It is actually over-engineered. However, in the end you basically will understand everything you need to create a larger more complex application and a code structure that will scale with your complexity.

Example uses express powered server. In Node.js 6-9 lines of code provides a full functioning if somewhat basic web server. 

Starting the server is as simple as running node server.js from your command line.

Once you start server. You can try below links
http://localhost:3000/
http://localhost:3000/91210
